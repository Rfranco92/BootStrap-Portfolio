              My name is Ryan Franco. I was born in Ocean Township, New Jersey. Before going into the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, I had done numerous things in my life. I went to college at Ursinus which is in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. There, I got a bachelor's degree in History and American Studies. I did some work study while there, including working with the Athletic Trainers and I even led a handful of charity events to benefit the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Afterwards, I was initially going to go to law school, but I changed my mind in the last year in order to support individuals with disabilities one on one. It became extremely stressful for me, and I eventually had to leave. That was when my attention turned to coding.

              I was initially unsure about coding. I once tried it out freshman year in high school, a class on C++, and was apprehensive about doing it again. However, after some persuasion and talking to numerous family members and friends, I decided to give it another go. Web Development is actually really cool, as web pages which appear extremely simple that we take for granted are in fact extremely complicated and filled with many algorithms and styles which help display what we see in front of us.
